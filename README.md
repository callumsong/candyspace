# Technical Task

## Frameworks used - jQuery and jQuery UI

I chose to use this as jQuery is a simple tool to have animations as specified. There is also a tool for allowing touch functionality, which I also added in. I used a CSV to JSON converter to convert the data to JSON first. I was considering persisting the data in a database such as MongoDB but given time pressures chose otherwise.

There was also use of Node.js to run a server so that users can access it on a localhost for now - please use npm install when you first get the repository.
